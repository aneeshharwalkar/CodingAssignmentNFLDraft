# Project Goal 
The goal of this project was to scrape a website containing the data from the 2023 NFL Draft and assess which NFL teams had the highest number of picks, and also the colleges with the most players drafted to the NFL. With this data I can extract information and make inferences on why these specific NFL teams are receiving more picks when they all start with seven. Additionally, this data can be used forhigh schools and high schoolers looking to play at the next level and see which colleges send the most players to the NFL.

# API 
I did not use an API for this code, as I scraped a wikipedia file.

# Data Types 
The data types of the columns are shown as the following:

"Round" = string 

"Pick #" = float 

"NFL Team" = string 

"Player Name" = string 

"Position" = string 

"College" = string

# Known or Potential Issues 
There is not much bias in the raw data and sourcing, at is all documented from the 2023 NFL Draft.
